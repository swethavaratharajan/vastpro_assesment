1. Write a program to find the sum of the series where x and n are passed from
command line. The value of x must be passed as a command line argument when the
program is invoked. (testing the usage of String[] args. If no argument is passed, then
the program must provide an error message and exit gracefully.)
1+(x^1)/1!+(x^2)/2!+(x^3)/3!+...+(x^n)n!
2. Write a program to generate Floyd's triangle.
1 1 1
 2 2 2 3 0 1
 3 3 3 4 5 6 0 1 0
 4 4 4 4 7 8 9 10 1 0 1 0
 ........... .......... ..........
3. Assume a flat GST of 18%. Write a program that accepts a product name and its
selling price on the command line as a prompt from user. Calculate the GST and print
the total bill amount with tax.
4. Modify the above tax program to accept an ‘n’ number of product names, their prices
in a loop. The program should continue to prompt the user, “enter next product”, till
the user types “e” for end. The program should then add all the product prices
entered, calculate the sales tax and print the total bill amount with the proper splitup
prices also printed.
5. Write a program that reads the base salary per day from the command line and
calculate the salary of an employee per month. assume 30 days per month. then
output the total pay due.
4. Modify the above program to assume a random loss of pay days between 0 & 4
and subtract the salary and print the following:
 salary per day
 number of days absent
 amount lost
 that month salary
